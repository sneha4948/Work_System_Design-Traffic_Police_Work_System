# Redefined Traffic Control System

- 23% of Traffic police officers are reported to be hypertensive, 12.2% have respiratory problems, 18.7% are associated with skin problems, 50.4% complain  of low back pain, 24.5% report eye problems, 14.4% have low PEFR, and 12.9% are found to have varicose veins by Trendelenbergâ€™s test. A significant association (p < 0.05) has been found between years of service and diabetes, hypertension, abnormal waist circumference, and usage of personal protective equipment (mask and sunglasses).

- They are there for us during weekdays and weekends, sun and rain. They are so exposed to the harsh weather.Be it 45deg. or 15deg, Day in and out they work hard for our safety and wellbeing on roads. Festivals and holidays, neither of these affect them

- We always find one crossing being handled by 4-5 traffic policemen and the next one with none. People cite that there are too few traffic policemen for the number of vehicles on the road.

- What if there is an even distribution with systematic handling?

The above-mentioned aspects made us rethink the current management process of the traffic police.

Hence, we are redesigning the complete traffic control system, taking ergonomic and uneven distribution factors into consideration. This will resolve the major issues of traffic control system.
